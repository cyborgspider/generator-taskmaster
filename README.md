A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io). Out of the box support for Jade, Stylus, Coffeescript, plus some other Grunt plugins.


## Getting Started
There's plenty of documentation and tutorials available for Yeoman. Here's a quick rundown:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-taskmaster from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-taskmaster
```

Finally, initiate the generator within your directory (a blank folder is fine. It will copy and install necessary files):

```
$ yo taskmaster
```

### Now What?
Play around with the Gruntfile to truly customize your site/app. Otherwise, you can just run "grunt build" or "grunt watch"
and check the contents of the build folder.
